Students are obliged to play with their designing skils and show their potential in creating a website. Throughout our first semester we've been provided with all the basic knowledge about HTML and CSS3 properties.We've learned to use animations without the help of Javascript. With the help of the mentor and discussion with group of friends the website is created.The plans for creating website is explained in sequence down below.The brief about website overview and the designs as well as the contents inside the website is also mentioned.All of the instructions are implemented and design constraints are executed making the website very user-friendly.The webpages are responsive according to the required width of the device.Stepping into the technological era we have to be the source of creation. This project helped students to understand that coding not only gives sense of fulfilment but also, the motive to create something out of nothing.<br><br>

 Designing phase includes all the color combination for the whole website, content co-ordination for the website to look attractive, margins to make it user-friendly and many other rules like use of eye-friendly color codes.The designs for all pages differs from each other. All the margins are managed and sections are divided to align items in a proper way just like the wire-frames(i.e. reference for the web-site sketched by pencil or digital wireframes from ms-word/paint.)</div>

<div class="rewrite">6. Conclusion<br><br>
The students had to work with various tags and css styles inside the html page which were taught by the mentor over the time-period of three months.It was very practical based assignment. The positive aspect is that students will now have idea to create basic web-site without having any problem.The assigments like this will help student prepare for the real-world. W3school.org was a great help in over-coming problems and adding more styles except those mentioned in our course.Going-through slides provided by the University was also very effective.<br>
If there was enough time, more animations would have been added along with drop down list and transtions in images.Due to lack of practice and less knowledge about these google material design,they weren't added.In coming days,the students will have gained deeper knowledge on this course and the practice carried out in this assignmnet will minimize the errors.
